# TODOLIST
# - Fix the possessor detection logic (as in the comment in player_ball_detector.py, i tried to set the class_id to 99 but it seems not working)
# - improve the team color recognition for each player
# - Fix the drawing of points that are not detected (frame 41/42 point 17 for example) just to know why it happens because we dont need to draw points to have the homography
# - Improve the drawing class with better structure and maybe more modularity
# - try to improve the model accuracy
